 About Me  
I am an **Engineering student** pursuing a degree in **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** at **USICT**. My academic and professional interests lie in exploring **core electronics** and diving deep into the fields of **neuroscience**, including both **dry lab (computational and theoretical)** and **wet lab (experimental)** approaches.  

 Skills and Interests  
- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in **Python** and **C**, and always eager to learn more.  
- **Electronics and Technology**: Passionate about working at the **component level** to understand and innovate in electronics.  
- **Interdisciplinary Science**: Keen on merging insights from **neuroscience** and **engineering** to explore new possibilities.  

 Goals  
I am looking to collaborate on projects that:  
- Align with my skills in **ECE**, programming, and neuroscience.  
- Offer opportunities to learn and grow, while contributing meaningfully to the team.
